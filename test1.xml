Project :Nielsen, My BuzzMetrics	7 Months
Nielsen Mobile (formerly Telephia) is the world's largest provider of syndicated consumer research to the telecom and mobile media markets. 
My BuzzMetrics is a fully-customizable social media analysis tool that allows brand managers to easily monitor and analyze what’s being said online about their brand or organization from a wide range of CGM sources. Accessible via a Web interface, My BuzzMetrics provides real-time analysis and segmentation capabilities, at-a-glance-metrics and a range of report and delivery options. 

To address the technical architecture’s current challenges, as well as to anticipate future ones, we created a Java based service layer to
efficiently transfer large volumes of data to the User Interface.This layer handles business logic, metadata access, AMP access, third party integration, Brand Association Map (BAM) report scheduling, data export (formats like excel, pdf, cvs, jpeg), Email feature and report queuing mechanism. Built upon Spring and JPA Hibernate frameworks, this java based layer acts as core of appliation. It provides more robust mechanism to handle customization and ease of integration with backend. Efficient data and report caching is implemented in this layer. Operation auditing, role/ privilege based security, transaction management, Scheduling with Quartz for functional and non-functional jobs and throttling number of request per user or per day or per month etc is handled. Also, it serves B2B layer (API layer for MyBuzzMetrics). Usage reporting which is used for billing and analysis of reports for clients is one of the key feature implemented.

Responsibilities:
	Leading and Mentoring the team members in ServiceLayer 
	Analysis of the different modules including report execution
	Design of the Report Execution, Report Caching, Localization
